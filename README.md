# CiviMobile Activity Category

[CiviMobile](https://civimobile.org) by default will display **all** Activity Types in the mobile app. This presents the user with **too many options** that are **not relevant** and is often cause for **confusion**.

This Extension limits the Activities shown in the CiviMobile app to only those Activities which have the Activity Category, _CiviMobile_.

When this Extension is installed a new option group, Activity Category is created. A new option is added to this group, _CiviMobile_. You can then update the Activity Types that you want displayed in the mobile app by setting the Activity Type, Activity Category to _CiviMobile_.
